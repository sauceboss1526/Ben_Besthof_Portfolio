# Heart Disease Classifier Overview

Developing predictive models help healthcare professionals to identify patients who are at high risk of heart disease. Early treatment can lead to higher quality of life, lower expenditures for health care and ultimately reduced insurance premiums. Our model will seek to identify patients with high risk factors for heart disease, so medical professionals can initiate preventive treatment as supposed to reactive treatment of heart disease.

This problem affects:
-Patients with heart diseases have lower quality of life.
-Government subsidized medical insurance coverage.
-Insurance companiesâ€™ payments/premiums for treatment (heart transplant, surgery).
